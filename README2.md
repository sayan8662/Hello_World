# Hello_World
First Repository
I have tried to find out the minimum accuracy by using several Machine Learning Algorithms like :-

1. Logistic Regression(Training Accuracy: 99.06, Testing Accuracy: 94.40), 
2. K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm(Training Accuracy: 97.65, Testing Accuracy: 95.80), 
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)(Linear Classifier)(Training Accuracy: 98.82, Testing Accuracy: 96.50) ,
4. Support Vector Machine (RBF Classifier)(Training Accuracy: 98.35, Testing Accuracy: 96.50),
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes(Training Accuracy: 95.07, Testing Accuracy: 92.30),
6. Decision Tree Classifier(Training Accuracy: 100, Testing Accuracy: 95.10),
7. Random Forest Classifier(Training Accuracy: 99.53, Testing Accuracy: 96.50)
